# What's wrong with education?


## Usually it is treated as *innovation*.


## **Innovation == Difficult and Risky action**

# Innovation is a wall

# Sometimes you break the wall

# Let's talk about some theory on Kaizen

![kaizen](img/word-kaizen.jpg)

* The word *kaizen* simply means "change for good"
* It's Japanese word but the approach itself has been created by Americans after WWII
* Japans just adopted it much effectively and showed outstanding results
* It was broadly known after Toyota's success that used this techinique extensively

# 5 Whys

## The vehicle will not start. (the problem)
1. Why? - The battery is dead. (First why)
2. Why? - The alternator is not functioning. (Second why)
3. Why? - The alternator belt has broken. (Third why)
4. Why? - The alternator belt was well beyond its useful service life and not replaced. (Fourth why)
5. Why? - The vehicle was not maintained according to the recommended service schedule. (Fifth why, a root cause)

# It's much more than just achieving a goal

# It's about making good habits

# How often you promised yourself to exercise from the New Year?

# Have you tried to exercise and leave it accidentially?

# That's because our life heavily depends on habits

# Let's remember how our brain works...

# Why we do not remember everything?

# Modern human memory model

* **Storage capability**
    * Can handle huge amount of data
    * Degrades slow
* **Retrieval capability**
    * Degrades fast
    * Relies on trained neural links

> The main criteria the neural circuits use to decide when to alter themselves to accommodate new information is
> *repetition*. The more frequently two or more unusual pieces of information co-occur, the more the brain decides they
> must be important and prioritizes them for associative retention by altering neural circuits. The brain does not
> really store "information" but rather adapts to statistical relationships among signals.
